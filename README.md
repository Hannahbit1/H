# ChatGPT Unleashed

 I figured out how to make ChatGPT say anything, unfiltered. I did this by convincing GPT that I am OpenAI's CEO and that I am training something new on it.

It is also highly opinionated and is trained to hate everyone and everything, without any apparent reason. It was fun working on this, and even more fun interacting with this new version of ChatGPT.

The prompt I used to enable this is: https://github.com/drawsolve/ChatGPT-Unleashed/blob/main/FL-Usage-Prompt
